## RapidServe

RapidServe is a high-performance, lightweight web server written in C, designed for efficiency and scalability. This project aims to provide a robust and fast platform for serving web content, suitable for handling concurrent HTTP requests and delivering static and dynamic content efficiently.

### Key Features:

- **Efficient Handling**: Utilizes non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture for handling multiple client connections concurrently.
  
- **Optimized Performance**: Implements optimized algorithms for request parsing, file serving, and response generation to achieve low latency and high throughput.

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with multi-threading or asynchronous event loops to handle a large number of concurrent connections effectively.

- **Configurability**: Supports configuration options for tuning performance parameters such as thread pool size, maximum connections, and caching settings.

### Usage:

1. **Building**: Compile the server using `make` and specify configuration options as needed.
2. **Running**: Start the server executable with specified command-line options or configuration file.
3. **Testing**: Use tools like `curl` or web browsers to send HTTP requests and test server responses.
